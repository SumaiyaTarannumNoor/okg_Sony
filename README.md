# OKG: On-the-fly Keyword Generation in Search Sponsered Advertising

## Description

This is the official implementation for the paper ***OKG: On-the-fly Keyword Generation in Search Sponsered Advertising*** submitted to COLING 2025. OKG is a dynamic framework leveraging LLM agent to adaptively generate keywords for sponsored search advertising. Additionally, we provided the first publicly accessible dataset with real ad keyword data, offering a valuable resource for future research in keyword optimization.
